# ADR-009: ADR Hygiene and Success Criteria

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The DDD refactoring plan includes multiple ADRs that need proper status management and success criteria. We need to establish clear ADR hygiene practices and ensure each ADR has measurable success criteria.

## Decision

**ADR Status Management and Success Criteria**

1. **Status Lifecycle**: Proposed → Accepted → Superseded
2. **Success Criteria**: Each ADR must have measurable success criteria
3. **Status Updates**: Update ADR status when implementation is committed
4. **Review Process**: Regular review of ADR status and success criteria

### Rationale
- **Clear Progress**: Track which decisions are implemented
- **Measurable Success**: Know when an ADR has been successfully implemented
- **Team Alignment**: Clear understanding of what needs to be done
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure decisions are properly implemented

## Implementation

### ADR Status Lifecycle
```
Proposed → Accepted → Superseded
    ↓         ↓
    └─────────┘
```

- **Proposed**: Initial decision, under review
- **Accepted**: Decision approved, implementation in progress
- **Superseded**: Decision replaced by newer ADR

### Success Criteria Template
Each ADR must include:
```markdown
## Success Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1: Specific, measurable outcome
- [ ] Criterion 2: Specific, measurable outcome
- [ ] Criterion 3: Specific, measurable outcome
```

#### ADR-004: Type Boundaries and Ownership
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Success Criteria**:
  - [ ] Port interfaces use pure transport types
  - [ ] Domain value objects are internal to bounded contexts
  - [ ] Adapters handle all type translation
  - [ ] No import cycles between ports and domain
  - [ ] All type conversions are explicit and testable

#### ADR-005: Naming Conventions
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Success Criteria**:
  - [ ] All packages use single-word names
  - [ ] No underscores in package names
  - [ ] Clear separation between domain, app, and infra layers
  - [ ] Consistent naming patterns across all bounded contexts
  - [ ] All imports follow the established structure

#### ADR-006: Eventing Scope Simplification
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Success Criteria**:
  - [ ] Domain events are defined and stored on aggregates
  - [ ] No EventBus implementation in Phase 1
  - [ ] Events can be retrieved for audit purposes
  - [ ] Clear path to add publishing in Phase 2
  - [ ] No event publishing infrastructure in Phase 1

#### ADR-007: CLI Contract Compliance
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Success Criteria**:
  - [ ] All commands use positional arguments only
  - [ ] No flags in command signatures
  - [ ] Feature toggles via environment variables
  - [ ] Public contract tests pass
  - [ ] CLI behavior is documented and tested

#### ADR-008: Characterization Tests Robustness
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Success Criteria**:
  - [ ] Template rendering tests verify processed content
  - [ ] PDF existence and size tests pass consistently
  - [ ] Text extraction tests verify content
  - [ ] Single smoke test for end-to-end verification
  - [ ] Domain and app layer tests cover business logic
  - [ ] Tests are fast and reliable

## ADR Review Process

### Weekly Review
- Review all ADRs for status updates
- Check success criteria completion
- Update status as implementation progresses
- Identify blockers and dependencies

### Implementation Checkpoints
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Update ADR-001 and ADR-002 status
- **Domain Model Complete**: Update ADR-003 status
- **Type Boundaries Complete**: Update ADR-004 status
- **Naming Complete**: Update ADR-005 status
- **Eventing Complete**: Update ADR-006 status
- **CLI Complete**: Update ADR-007 status
- **Tests Complete**: Update ADR-008 status

## Benefits

1. **Clear Progress**: Track implementation status
2. **Measurable Success**: Know when goals are achieved
3. **Team Alignment**: Clear understanding of requirements
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure proper implementation
5. **Documentation**: Clear record of decisions and outcomes

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All ADRs have clear success criteria
- [ ] ADR status is updated as implementation progresses
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable and specific
- [ ] Regular review process is established
- [ ] ADR status reflects current implementation state

## Consequences

- **Maintenance Overhead**: Need to keep ADR status updated
- **Review Process**: Need regular review of ADR status
- **Documentation**: Need to maintain ADR documentation

## Mitigation

- **Automated Checks**: Use CI to check ADR status
- **Regular Reviews**: Weekly ADR status review
- **Clear Process**: Document ADR update process
- **Team Training**: Ensure team understands ADR process
